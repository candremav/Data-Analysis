# Banking Marketing Dataset Analysis

This dataset was created to predict whether a client will subscribe to a bank term deposit. The data were analyzed to understand the impact of social and economic attributes on the success of bank telemarketing. Part I of this project conducts a comprehensive analysis of an marketing dataset. Utilizing data manipulation and visualization tools such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project uncovers key insights into customer characteristics.
