# Earthquake Dataset Analysis (1990-2023)

This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of an earthquake dataset, covering events from 1990 to 2023. Utilizing data manipulation and visualization tools such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project uncovers key insights into seismic activities and their various characteristics.

## Notebook Structure

1. **Database Analysis**: Initial exploration of the earthquake dataset to understand its structure, contents, and key attributes.
2. **Graphs**: Creating a range of visualizations to represent different aspects of seismic data, such as frequency, magnitude, and distribution of earthquakes.
3. **Map Graphs**: Employing advanced graphical representations to map earthquake occurrences geographically, providing spatial insights into seismic activities.
4. **Group Comparisons**: Conducting comparative analyses to examine differences and patterns across various types of seismic events, enhancing the understanding of distinct seismic phenomena.

## Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to analyze and understand the patterns and nuances of seismic activities over the years. By examining different types of earthquakes and related events, the analysis aims to contribute valuable insights into the field of seismology and earthquake preparedness.
